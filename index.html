                    <p>Developed an application that to save time and reduce crowding of people.(JAVA)</p>
                    <p>There are a lot of people who crowd the barber shop at certain times, or at different times. Which makes people waste time waiting for their turn. 
                        To solve this problem, we can create an application that helps in booking an appointment for everyone who wants a barber shop, which makes it easier and more timesaving and prevents sudden crowding of people. 
                        Through this simple application, we were able to save time and reduce crowding of people.

                    <p>Developed a Basic calculator with adjusted couple of things.(ASM)</p>
                    <p>For example, after the user chooses an operation, we adjusted the result 
                        message to be more specific for each operation and it will also print the 
                        numbers that the user entered</p>
                    <p>Also, after the user gets the result, we added the options to let the user do 
                        another arithmetic operation or exit the program by writing 1 or 0 as true or 
                        false</p>
                    <p>Also, it is allowed mid choosing the operation list just if the user wants to exit 
                        the program,if the user decides to exit the program it will also print a “ thank you “  
                        message </p>
